- profile code with solve_gpu to identify the slowest parts of the batch building code

- test solve_gpu on a proper GPU and measure speedups for several num_factors/batch_size values

- maybe also consider using Cython to speed up the for loop and numpy array indexing?

- The algorithm could be adapted to work with CSR representations stored on disk in e.g. HDF5 format (for very large matrices). Try this?
