- test solve_gpu on a proper GPU and measure speedups for several num_factors/batch_size values

- depending on how much time is taken up doing sparse computations on the CPU / dense computations on the GPU, it might be useful to do these in parallel (using one or more generators running in separate processes).

- The algorithm could be adapted to work with CSR representations stored on disk in e.g. HDF5 format (for very large matrices). Try this?
