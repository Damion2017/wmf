- add biases. Should be doable based on the lyxfile.

- make a version that batches up inversions (with specified batch size) and passes them off to a helper function.

- implement a dummy batched inversion that just does them in sequence

- implement a batched inversion on the CPU using multiprocessing

- implement a batched inversion on the GPU using scikits.cuda
